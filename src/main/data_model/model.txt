The data schema for a diagnostic management software (DMS) may vary depending on the specific software implementation and the types of medical data being managed. However, here are some key components that may be included:

Patient Data: This includes demographic information such as name, date of birth, gender, contact information, and medical history. It may also include information on medical conditions, allergies, medications, and previous diagnostic tests.

Diagnostic Test Data: This includes information about the tests performed, such as the type of test, the date it was performed, the results, and any relevant notes or comments. The data schema may also include information on the testing facility and the healthcare provider who ordered the test.

Decision Support Data: This includes data used by the DMS to generate recommendations or alerts based on the patient's data and test results. This could include clinical decision rules, algorithms, or machine learning models.

Imaging Data: This includes images obtained from medical imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs. The schema may include metadata about the images, such as the date taken, the modality used, and the body part imaged.

Integration Data: This includes data used to integrate with other healthcare information systems, such as electronic health records (EHRs). The schema may include information on patient identifiers, data formats, and security protocols.

Security Data: This includes data used to secure patient information, such as user access controls, encryption keys, and audit logs. The schema may also include information on compliance with regulatory standards, such as HIPAA.
